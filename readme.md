Memo 

    npm run build and it created build folder 
    firebase init 
    select hosting , 
    What do you want to use as your public directory? build 
    Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes 
    File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No 
    and then finally firebase deploy
